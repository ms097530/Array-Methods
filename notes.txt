for deleting, copy elements from just after delete count and overwrite them, after inserting all provided items



Example:

[1,2,3,4,5]

delete 2,3

so swap 2 and 4 and 3 and 5
so array loooks like [1,4,5,2,3]
then subtract 2 from length
so result is [1,4,5]


steps
1. 


[1,2,3,4,5].splice(-2, 1)
SHOULD start at index 3
SHOULD delete 4
SHOULD have [1,2,4,5] after
SHOULD return [4] -> does return [4]
